[01/27 12:40:12] [fraudulent] Marissa Torres initiated a large refund request for her recent purchase, despite having just made the transaction hours ago. This behavior is highly suspicious.
[01/27 12:43:56] [fraudulent] The large refund was processed immediately and credited to Marissa's account, even though it hadn't been reviewed by our fraud prevention team yet.
